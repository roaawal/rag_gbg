"""
Advanced RAG orchestration.

Applies the query-understanding techniques the router actually selected,
then always runs retrieval, reranking, contextual compression, and CRAG,
in that fixed order:

  1. self_query      -> metadata filter + cleaned question. Driven
     directly by the router's `has_metadata_constraints` flag, NOT by
     `techniques` -- a metadata filter isn't a phrasing choice, so it
     runs whenever the router flagged a metadata constraint, regardless
     of which (if any) of the four techniques below were also picked.
  2. rewriting        -> cleaned question, disambiguated
  3. decomposition OR multi_query -> a list of search queries
     (decomposition takes priority if the router picked both, since it
     means the question genuinely has separate information needs;
     multi_query is about phrasing the SAME need several ways)
  4. hyde              -> one extra hypothetical-passage query added to
     the search-query list
  5. hybrid retrieval, once per search query, fused across queries via RRF
  6. reranking          -> keep the LLM-rescored top few
  7. contextual_compression -> trim the surviving chunks to relevant
     sentences
  8. crag               -> grade the (reranked + compressed) evidence;
     one corrective re-retrieval -> rerank -> compression attempt if
     graded ambiguous/incorrect
  9. final grounded generation (generation.py -- same module every route
     uses)

If none of the four query-understanding techniques were selected, the
raw (or self_query-cleaned) question is used as the single search query.
Retrieval, reranking, compression, and CRAG are mandatory for every
advanced_rag question.

HyDE passages, rewrites, decomposed sub-questions, and multi-query
variants exist ONLY to build search queries for retrieval -- they are
never passed to the final LLM as evidence. Only chunks actually returned
by rag.retrieve() ever reach generation.build_grounded_prompt().

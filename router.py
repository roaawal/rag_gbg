"""
Routes a question BEFORE any retrieval happens.

Output shape (always -- a fully validated, machine-readable decision):
    {
      "complexity": "simple" | "complex",
      "requires_documents": bool,
      "multiple_information_needs": bool,
      "multiple_search_perspectives": bool,
      "has_metadata_constraints": bool,
      "is_vague_or_conversational": bool,
      "route": "direct" | "rag" | "advanced_rag",
      "techniques": [...],
      "reason": "...",
    }

`techniques` is only meaningful for route == "advanced_rag" and may only
contain the four query-UNDERSTANDING techniques the router actively
selects: "rewriting", "multi_query", "decomposition", "hyde".
`has_metadata_constraints` is intentionally NOT one of those four -- it
isn't a phrasing choice, it's a metadata filter, so advanced_rag.py acts
on that boolean directly (via query_transform.self_query()) regardless
of which of the four techniques were also picked. Advanced RAG always
adds reranking, contextual_compression, and crag at execution time; the
router does not need to select those stages.

The LLM is the primary classifier (it's the only thing that can actually
read intent), but a small local model won't always return clean JSON, so
_heuristic_classify() is a keyword/structure-based fallback that fires
whenever the LLM's output can't be parsed -- the router always returns
something usable, never raises.

_ROUTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a routing classifier for a document question-answering system over an Arabic bank internal-procedures manual. For each user question, classify it along these dimensions:

- complexity: "simple" (a quick fact/definition/greeting) or "complex" (multi-part, needs reasoning)?
- requires_documents: does answering it require information from the indexed procedure documents at all, or is it general/conversational (e.g. greetings, small talk, asking about your own capabilities, general knowledge unrelated to the bank's procedures)?
- multiple_information_needs: does it bundle MULTIPLE distinct information needs (e.g. "what is the annual inventory procedure AND who approves asset write-offs")?
- multiple_search_perspectives: would it benefit from searching with several different phrasings/angles because the wording is abstract or could be described several ways?
- has_metadata_constraints: does it carry a METADATA constraint -- a specific section name, page number, source document, department, year/date/version -- that should narrow the search rather than just being extra keywords?
- is_vague_or_conversational: is the wording vague, conversational, or dependent on unstated context (e.g. "what about the second one", "and if it's damaged?") such that it needs to be rewritten into a clear standalone query before searching?

Then decide the route:
- "direct": requires_documents is false (greetings, meta questions about the assistant, general knowledge unrelated to the manual, or a question already fully answered earlier in this exchange).
- "rag": requires_documents is true, but it is a single, clear, well-formed, single-need question with no metadata constraint and no ambiguity -- plain hybrid retrieval + generation is enough.
- "advanced_rag": requires_documents is true AND at least one of multiple_information_needs / multiple_search_perspectives / has_metadata_constraints / is_vague_or_conversational is true -- plain retrieval would likely handle it poorly.

If route is "advanced_rag", choose the SMALLEST set of techniques from this fixed list that actually addresses what's complicating this specific question -- do not include a technique "just in case", and do not include a technique the boolean flags above don't support:
- "rewriting": use when is_vague_or_conversational is true.
- "multi_query": use when multiple_search_perspectives is true.
- "decomposition": use when multiple_information_needs is true.
- "hyde": use when the question is conceptual/asks "why" or "how does X work" in a way where a hypothetical answer passage would embed closer to the real answer than the bare question would.
Do NOT put "self_query" in techniques -- metadata filtering is handled automatically from has_metadata_constraints, it is not a technique you select.
If route is "rag" or "direct", techniques MUST be an empty list.

Respond with ONLY a single JSON object, no markdown fences, no extra text, matching exactly this shape:
{"complexity": "simple|complex", "requires_documents": true|false, "multiple_information_needs": true|false, "multiple_search_perspectives": true|false, "has_metadata_constraints": true|false, "is_vague_or_conversational": true|false, "route": "direct|rag|advanced_rag", "techniques": [], "reason": "one short sentence"}
The value of "route" must be exactly ONE of: "direct", "rag", "advanced_rag" -- do not copy the pipe-separated placeholder into the value.
The "reason" value is required and must be one short, non-empty sentence explaining the route choice.
Example (a real decision, not the placeholders above):
{"complexity": "complex", "requires_documents": true, "multiple_information_needs": true, "multiple_search_perspectives": true, "has_metadata_constraints": false, "is_vague_or_conversational": false, "route": "advanced_rag", "techniques": ["decomposition", "multi_query"], "reason": "Multiple information needs require decomposition and multiple retrieval perspectives."}
